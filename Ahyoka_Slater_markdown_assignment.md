| Program Name   | Comments  | Rating out of 3  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Microsfot Excel| Offline and Online. Industry Standard. Expensive. Takes too long to load. Can't exit with the click of a button. | 1/3 |
| Google Sheets| Online. Easy to open and as easy to close. May not be a 1:1 to Microsoft Excel in regards to functions and formulas. |   2/3 |
| Gnumereic| Offline. Amazing for doing simple offline calculations and spreadsheet works. But only runs on Linux OS to my knowlege|    2/3|
